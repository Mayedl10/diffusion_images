# diffusion_images
uses every word in "missed.json" as a prompt for stable diffusion. If it crashes (or fails 60 times in a row), all unused words get dumped to "missed.json" for later use. Don't forget to add your api key. use "downscale.py" to downscale the images. Make sure to create a folder "out" int the same place as "main.py" for this to work. (And an output folder for the downscaling stuff)
